  about:`I am a skilled and dedicated Architect with a passion for creating innovative and functional designs.
   With a diploma in Architecture from the Technical University of Mombasa and a strong background 
   in Information Communication Technology, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creative vision to my work.

Throughout my professional journey, I have gained extensive experience in software integration, installation of internet
 and Wi-Fi, and have worked on various architectural projects, including residential homes, office blocks, and rental bedsitters.
  I am proficient in using ArchiCAD versions 19 to 24, as well as rendering software such as Lumion and Twinmotion, 
  which allows me to bring designs to life and present them in a visually appealing manner.

I am detail-oriented, deadline-driven, and possess excellent reporting and research skills. 
I am adept at managing multiple tasks and projects simultaneously, while maintaining a high level of accuracy and confidentiality. 
My proficiency in office automation tools such as MS Word, PowerPoint, and Excel enables me to efficiently organize and present 
project-related information.

As a natural leader and effective communicator, I thrive in collaborative environments and value teamwork. I am known for my 
problem-solving abilities and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. I am dedicated to delivering high-quality 
work and exceeding client expectations.

Fluent in both English and Kiswahili, I am able to effectively communicate with clients, colleagues, and stakeholders 
from diverse backgrounds.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading magazines and journals to stay updated on industry trends, listening to music
 for inspiration, swimming for relaxation, and watching to broaden my creative horizons.

I invite you to review my portfolio, which showcases my projects, including 4-bedroom homes, 3-bedroom bungalows,
 office blocks, and renders. I am confident that my skills, experience, and passion for architecture make me a valuable
  asset to any design team.

Please feel free to reach out to my referees, Mr. Mwatu and Architect Alex Maninga, who can provide further insight into 
my professional capabilities and work ethic.

I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to your
 organization and to collaborate on exciting architectural projects.`,
